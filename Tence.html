<h1>Tenses</h1></p>
<p>In Grammar, we use 'Tenses' to define the time of occurring of the action. The tenses in a 
sentence show the time of an action or state of being as shown by a verb. Actions can take 
place in Past state, Present state or future state. So there are 3 main types of tenses which are 
defined as follows:</p>
<p><b>Present Tense:</b> The actions which are doing presently are classified into 'Present tense'. For 
example:</p>
<p> <b>• </b>He is eating Pasta. (Presently he is doing this action of eating)</p>
<p><b>Past Tense: </b>The actions which we have already done are classified into 'Past tense'.</p>
<p><b>• </b>He ate Pasta (He has already done the action of eating)</p>
<p><b>Future Tense: </b>The actions which we are going to do/will do/planning to do are termed as 
'Future tense' sentences.</p>
<p><b>•</b> He will eat Pasta (He is going to do the action of eating)</p>
<p>These 3 tenses are split into 4-4 parts, resulting in total 12 types of Tenses, which are 
described as following:</p>

<h1>Present Tense</h1>
<h3>1) Simple Present Tense:</h3>
<p>This tense is used when we want to describe an action that is happening at present. But this tense 
does not indicate when that action is expected to end. Simple present tense is used when:</p>
<p><b>• </b>If an action has regularity, which means if an action happens every day/every time/every 
week/every month/every year, then we use 'Simple Present tense for such actions.</p>
<p><b>•</b>To indicate facts that are universally true.</p>
<p><b>•</b> Habitual action that happened in past, happening in present and will happen in future.</p>

<h3>Important Rules of Tenses:</h3>
<p>Below mentioned are some important rules and most common errors of Tenses in English Grammar:</p>
<p>1) Do not get confused between use of Present continuous tense and Present perfect continuous 
Tense. To indicate an action which started in the past has gone on till the present and is still 
continuing, We use the present perfect continuous tense. Using 'Present continuous tense in such 
sentences is incorrect.<b> For example:</b></p>
<p><b>• Incorrect: </b>It is raining for two days.
<p><b>• Correct:</b> It has been raining for two days.</p>
<p>2) Do not get confused between present perfect tense/the past perfect tense and simple past 
tense. In a sentence, With adverbs of past time like, 'last week', 'last Monday', 'yesterday', 'last 
night' etc, always use simple past tense. Using Present perfect tense is incorrect in these 
sentences. Present perfect tense is to denote an action that continued in present too. Past 
perfect tense is only used to talk about the earlier of two past actions.<b> For example:</b></p>
<p><b>• Incorrect:</b> I have seen him yesterday.</p>
<p><b>• Incorrect:</b> I had seen him yesterday.</p>
<p><b>• Correct: </b>I saw him yesterday.</p>
