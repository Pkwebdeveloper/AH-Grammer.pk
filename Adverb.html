  <h3 id="line" > Rules of Adverb</h3>
   <p><b> Rule 1:</b> Adverbs should be placed before or after the word they are modifying. For example :</p>
 <p>   <b>•</b> I somewhat understand what you are saying (Here the adverb 'Somewhat' modifies the verb 
    'understand')</p>
<p>    In most of the sentences, adverb comes after the verb/adjective/adverb. For example :</p>
<p><b>    • Incorrect:</b> He clearly speaks.</p>
 <p><b>   • Correct:</b> He speaks clearly.</p>
 <p>  <b> Rule 2: </b>When there is an object, the adverb is usually placed after the verb + object.For 
    example :</p>
  <p><b>  • Incorrect:</b> I put carefully the vase on the table.</p>
    <p><b>•Correct:</b> I put the vase carefully on the table.</p>
  <p><b>  Rule 3:</b> However, adverbs are never positioned between the verb and the object.For example 
    :</p>
  <p><b>  • Incorrect:</b> I read quickly the book.</p>
  <p><b>  •Correct:</b> I read the book quickly.</p>
   <p><b> Rule 4: </b>Sometimes adverbs are placed at the beginning of a clause.For example :</p>
  <p><b>  •</b> Quickly, I changed my opinion.</p>
  <p><b>  Rule 5:</b> The adverb only should come immediately before the word it modifies.For example :</p>
   <p><b> • Incorrect: </b>I only solved two problems.</p>
 <p><b>   • Correct: </b>I solved only two problems.</p>
